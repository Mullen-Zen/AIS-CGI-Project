With this tool, my goal is to offer both students and business decision makers valuable insight into trends of their future applicant pools, which can offer good insight into their own ability to hire and compensate competitively in upcoming cycles as well as plan for future staff pool expansion or shrinkage. Additionally, career-oriented students entering university can use this tool to assist in choosing a degree path.

To run:

```.sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
