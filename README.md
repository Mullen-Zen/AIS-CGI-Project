  With this software, advisors, universities, and prospective students can break the curse of reactive degree acquisition trends that match 4-years-corrected market activity. Using public data from data.gov, IPEDS, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, greater understanding of the outlook for a given career path can be gained, and a more robust education/career plan developed. With this tool, an advisor, a student, or an HR manager selects a graduation year and a degree path. Detailed statistics are generated from the above sources, including a "saturation score," which indicates the ratio of graduates to job openinsgs, and "smart alternatives," or similar degree paths with lower saturation and/or more available jobs. 
  
  This tool can offer both students and business decision makers valuable insight into trends of their future applicant pools, which can offer good insight into their own ability to hire and compensate competitively in upcoming cycles as well as plan for future staff pool expansion or shrinkage. Additionally, career-oriented students entering university can use this tool to assist in choosing a degree path. After all, a degree is the largest investment of many young adults' lives - the more information and insight there is to gain, the better. Every stakeholder and beneficiary of the talents developed therein benefits from smart, strategic degree choices.
